Giza AI Agent with StarkNet Integration
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of AI Agents with StarkNet using the Giza framework. The project includes creating an AI agent that interacts with the StarkNet blockchain, leveraging starknet.py for communication due to StarkNet's non-EVM compatibility.
The main.py script provides an example of how to load an account and interact with the StarkNet blockchain using an AI agent. It includes code for initializing the account, setting up the client, and performing blockchain operations.
